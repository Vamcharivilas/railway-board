# TrainReservation
The Train Reservation project uses Hibernate and MySQL to manage and store train reservation data efficiently. Hibernate, as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, simplifies database interactions by mapping Java objects to MySQL tables. It handles operations like booking reservations, managing train schedules, and passenger details, while ensuring data integrity and consistency. MySQL serves as the relational database where all reservation data is stored and retrieved using Hibernate, offering a smooth and flexible way to manage the data with minimal manual SQL queries.
